00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.570
<i>I'm scared...</i>

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.700
<i>Scared of digging down deep into my mind.</i>

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.050
I don't see any outright flaws in your art.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.510
But, well... how do I put it?

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.470
You need to dig down deeper as you draw.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.680
Your work's too restrained.
It doesn't reflect who you are.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.890
You're 29 years old, right?

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.100
I'm not sure you'd be a good fit for us.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.690
The 2006 World Cup in Germany
is now just 26 days away...

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.860
<i>Every day, the words "If only I'd done
things differently" go through my mind.</i>

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.660
<i>Never with a sense of genuine regret, though.</i>

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.830
<i>It's just an excuse that comes and goes.</i>

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.330
<i>I'm scared of digging down deep into my mind.</i>

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.260
I'm going on a delivery run.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.140
Okay. Take care.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.310
I'm heading out, too.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.600
Okay. Take care.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.270
Oh, Fujinuma-san.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.570
Don't eat the pizza on the way there, okay?

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.230
<i>I don't get it.</i>

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.320
<i>Is that a joke only millennials would get?</i>

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.650
Wasn't planning on it.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.660
<i>She says the same thing
every time we run into each other.</i>

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.120
<i>In fact, it's the only thing
she's ever said to me.</i>

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.420
<i>She doesn't seem to have
any feelings for me, either.</i>

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.790
<i>What a strange girl.</i>

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.840
<i>Not that I'm interested in kids.</i>

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.100
<i>There's no doubt about it.</i>

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.850
<i>It happened again.</i>

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.730
<i>Where is it?</i>

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.940
<i>Something must be wrong.</i>

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.660
Hey, you in the truck! Pull over!

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.960
Hey, driver!

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.470
Fujinuma-san?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.510
What is he doing?

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.850
<i>Damn it, I knew I shouldn't
have gotten involved.</i>

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.810
<i>But...</i>

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.110
<i>But...</i>

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.410
Are you okay?

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.280
That was close!

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.040
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.460
<i>Oh, I guess it's my life
flashing before my eyes.</i>

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.840
<i>See? Nothing good comes out of
getting involved with others.</i>

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.390
<i>Well, it doesn't really matter if I die.</i>

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.850
<i>Huh?</i>

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.690
His eyes are open.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.900
Good morning, Fujinuma-san.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.160
It's been two days.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.660
Katagiri-kun?

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.420
Do you remember who you are
and why you're here?

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.170
Fujinuma Satoru, 29 years old.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.590
I was chasing a truck and got in an accident.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.720
Thank goodness!

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.470
It's a miracle you hardly suffered any injuries.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.720
Is there anyone you want me to contact?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.890
A friend, or maybe a girlfriend?

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.310
No, thanks.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.650
There's nobody I want to bother telling.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.770
Snip, snip.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.990
What is that, a joke only millennials would get?

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.240
It's like you're covered
with a thin membrane.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.330
You don't seem like the type
to open up to others.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.160
You never smile, either.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.710
But I'm impressed.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.500
Why's that?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.170
You saved a kid, didn't you?

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.790
I was there when it happened.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.090
Apparently, the truck driver died
of a heart attack at the wheel.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.800
I'm amazed you noticed.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.760
I just got lucky.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.010
After you got hit, 
the truck crashed into a warehouse.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.720
You and the truck driver
were the only casualties.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.560
<i>Casualties...</i>

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.810
Don't worry,
 I told the manager{Boss} the whole story.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.400
He said not to worry about the bike or
the car you hit and to just come back to work.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.440
Thanks.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.070
You smiled for a second there!

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.620
Hey, Katagiri-kun...

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.330
Why do you work?

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.290
Wow, you're digging surprisingly deep.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.160
Am I?

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.330
Yeah. Nobody's ever asked me that before.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.920
I have a dream.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.380
Oh, okay.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.800
That's it?

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.260
Don't you ever have second thoughts
about telling people your dream?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.140
What if it doesn't come true?

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.730
I wouldn't be embarrassed to talk about it.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.440
I feel like if you say something
out loud, it'll eventually come true.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.820
<i>For some reason,
those words feel very nostalgic.</i>

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.370
It's not like I'd tell you anyway, though.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.370
We're not that close.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.000
Well, then. I'm gonna call the nurse and head home.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.120
Bye-bye!

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.590
<i>What a strange girl.</i>

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.760
<i>I call the phenomenon "Revival."</i>

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.140
<i>I know it'll only cause me trouble, but I still get involved.</i>

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.350
<i>I go back in time by about one to five minutes
and watch the same scene play out again.</i>

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.070
<i>It's always right before
something bad happens.</i>

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.150
<i>It's almost like someone's forcing me to prevent it.</i>

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.700
<i>I find myself trying to figure out what's wrong.</i>

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.700
<i>As a result, I've prevented
several accidents from occurring.</i>

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.420
<i>Most of the time, a negative outcome just turns into a neutral one.</i>

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.420
<i>But sometimes, like in this case,
it turns the negative onto me.</i>

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.730
Oh, welcome back, Satoru.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.900
Ma.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.460
I went to check on you at the hospital,
but you were out cold.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.280
That wasn't much fun, so I came here.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.280
Your head okay?

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.160
Yeah, all good.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.290
I nearly had a heart attack when
I heard it was a head-on collision.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.960
I'm gonna stay here a while.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.880
What? Why?

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.010
My precious baby boy,
my only son, hit his head.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.680
Least I can do is watch over him.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.470
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.260
I only have one bed, anyway.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.970
That sleeping bag I saw
in your closet will do.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.180
Get a hotel room.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.890
And waste my money?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.020
Oh, I'll pay you back for the hospital bills.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.900
Keep it as my share of the rent.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.360
<i>She hasn't changed one bit.
Even I can't believe she's 52, and I'm her son.</i>

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.240
Satoru, can I take a direct
train to Ueno from here?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.450
So you aren't here just to look after me after all.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.170
Well, I did come all the way here from Hokkaido.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.670
I'd get bored just looking at your mug every day.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.880
<i>You haven't even looked at it for a day yet.</i>

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.010
Well, let's eat.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.310
Sorry about hogging the bed and the TV.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.730
No worries.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.940
<i>What bothers me more is having to be careful
when I go to the bathroom at night.</i>

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.400
By the way, no need to be careful
when you go to the bathroom at night.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.650
I won't wake up that easily.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.610
<i>She's a demon.</i>

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.660
In other news today,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:48.410
the first-grader who was reported
missing yesterday evening in Saitama

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.420
was found safe this morning in Yokohama.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.000
Say, Satoru. Do you remember?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.720
She was taken to the hospital
but did not have any injuries.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.710
Remember what?

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.760
What happened in our neighborhood
when you were in fifth grade.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.180
The Ina Police Station has reported
that an unemployed man

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.180
Guess your memory of it is hazy.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.890
from Nishi-ku, Yokohama
was with the girl at the scene.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:12.650
He has been arrested on suspicion
of abducting a minor.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.520
We were desperate.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.650
We tried to erase as much of that incident
from your memories as possible.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.780
Your life was in danger.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.200
<i>When I was in fifth grade...</i>

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.490
<i>Kidnapping?</i>

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.090
<i>Two of my classmates died.</i>

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.280
<i>When I was a kid, there was this guy
we called "Yuuki-san," who was around 20 years old,</i>

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.780
<i>who often played with me.</i>

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.950
<i>His name wasn't really Yuuki.</i>

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.370
<i>We just called him that because
he always talked about "yuuki," or courage.</i>

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.210
L-Let me guess what
the popular guy in your c-class is like.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.790
He's a cheerful guy who's good at sports.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.760
He speaks his mind,
and while he messes around a lot,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.510
he has one thing
he's extremely serious about.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.510
Wow.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.220
That's what most popular guys are like.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.270
Wh-Why don't you try being like him?

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.270
Even in just one or two ways.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.020
Don't be embarrassed.
Show some courage.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.820
<i>Six months after the incident,</i>

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.700
<i>Shiratori Jun was arrested as
a serial kidnapper and murderer.</i>

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.700
<i>It was Yuuki-san.</i>

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.930
Don't you think you bought a bit too much?

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.800
What, too heavy for you?

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.720
Well, people can live on curry for days.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.900
Oh, dear.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.810
This is why I told you not to run.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.280
Let's go back and buy another cone, okay?

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.790
Satoru, what's wrong?

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.450
Nothing.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.500
What, too heavy for you?

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.420
Well, people can live on curry for days.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.210
<i>Another Revival?</i>

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.590
Oh, dear.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.630
This is why I told you not to run.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.800
Let's go back and buy another cone, okay?

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.970
<i>Crap, I have no idea what it is.</i>

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.180
<i>What is it? What's going to happen?</i>

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.730
Ma, could you take a look around for me?

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.690
Does anything seem off to you?

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.570
What're you talking about?

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.120
I remember you being like this a long time ago.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.280
Really?

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.660
I think it was about a small fire back then.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.840
<i>Was he just looking at me?</i>

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.930
<i>Nothing happened?</i>

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.020
Fujinuma-san!

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.690
Hey!

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.400
What? No way! That's your mom?!

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.360
I could've sworn she was your sister!

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.860
Do you believe in demons?

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.620
As of today, I do.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.370
Wait, did you have a fight?

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.160
Nah.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.750
Airi-san, was it?

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.580
Care to join us for dinner?
I'm making curry.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.470
I'm Katagiri Airi!
I gladly accept your offer!

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.670
I'll help you make it, too!

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.670
<i>Seriously?</i>

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.220
I'm starving!

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.640
Huh? You draw manga?

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.270
Come as a surprise?

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.640
No, not at all.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.810
Wow, it's true. You're on Wikitannica.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.110
Quit looking me up.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.980
Why? You're awesome.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.820
Come, let's eat.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.700
<i>It bothers me because I'm not awesome.</i>

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.030
Bon appétit!

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.700
This is amazing!

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.080
Thanks.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.290
I thought you were a bit young to be
his girlfriend, but I guess I got it wrong.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.460
You're such a good cook, too.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.250
Sorry, it's different.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.300
Fujinuma-san's more like...

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.130
a friend I respect.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.760
What, too spicy for you?

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.680
Nah, it's great.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.100
Thanks for the food!

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.980
I'll take you to the station.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.650
You're leaving already?

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.480
You could just stay the night.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.780
Katagiri-kun's a highschooler, you know.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.490
Thanks for having me over for dinner, Satoru-san.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.740
No problem.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.330
Just keep an eye out for cops.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:07.950
Sure.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.040
Welcome back.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.920
She's my co-worker.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.220
Stop making her out to be
a prospective daughter-in-law!

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.260
You're so dense.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.390
You've got a chance with her.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.810
She said she respects you.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.020
I'm telling you, it's not like that!

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.480
She was just being polite!
Don't take it so seriously!

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.400
That Airi-chan girl wouldn't
act polite for the sake of it.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.610
Oh, right.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.900
Your landlady came by for the rent earlier.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.860
I see.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.200
Satoru, about what happened this afternoon...

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.910
At the supermarket parking lot.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.450
Oh. What about it?

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.170
A kidnapping attempt was foiled.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.080
What'd you just say?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.920
I'm kidding, obviously.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:18.770
<i>She was one of my classmates
who was kidnapped and killed.</i>

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.280
<i>Hinazuki Kayo.</i>

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.950
<i>I always saw her alone at the park.</i>

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.530
<i>We weren't really friends, though.</i>

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.830
<i>That was the last I ever saw of Hinazuki.</i>

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.750
I could've saved her!

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.300
If I'd asked her to walk home with me,
Hinazuki would still be...

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.930
<i>That was what I wanted to forget the most.</i>

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.180
<i>And probably what my mother
actually tried to make me forget.</i>

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.230
You need to dig down deeper as you draw.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.360
Your work's too restrained.
It doesn't reflect who you are.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.030
<i>The license plate indicated it was a rental car.</i>

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.620
<i>It was definitely a kidnapping attempt.</i>

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.330
<i>Did he give up because he saw me?</i>

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.870
<i>He hid his face when our eyes met.</i>

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.500
<i>He knew who I was.</i>

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.710
<i>I'm sure I know a man with those eyes.</i>

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.170
<i>It's on the tip of my tongue.</i>

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.260
<i>When and where have I met him?</i>

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.970
<i>I remember!</i>

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.640
<i>I remember the man with those eyes.</i>

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.350
<i>Maybe Shiratori-kun wasn't actually the culprit.</i>

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:48.780
Hello?

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.530
It's been a while.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.280
It's Fujinuma Sachiko.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.660
<i>The statute of limitations has passed
on the case from 18 years ago.</i>

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.590
<i>But he's surely committed several crimes
with the same MO since then.</i>

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.340
<i>That case isn't closed yet.</i>

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.930
<i>I've gotta talk to Satoru.</i>

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.720
<i>It's time to tell him about what happened.</i>

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.310
Satoru?

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.410
<i>I knew it.</i>

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.960
<i>I have to call Satoru.</i>

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.710
<i>I have to tell him not to come home.</i>

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.920
<i>I have to apologize.</i>

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.470
I could've saved her!

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.760
There's no way it was Yuuki-san!

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.550
It couldn't have been him, Mom!

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.810
<i>I should've listened to him then.</i>

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.480
<i>Even if the police didn't...</i>

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.270
<i>I, of all people...</i>

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.020
<i>should've believed him.</i>

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.950
<i>Satoru...</i>

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.870
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.550
I'm heading home.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.380
Good night!

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.380
Yeah, good night.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.130
Good night!

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.340
Good night!

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.760
Hey, Satoru-san.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.760
Let me guess what you had for breakfast.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.680
Curry.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.980
Bingo.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.810
Yes!

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.060
<i>Is it any surprise given how much she made?</i>

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.070
Hey, ask her if I can put in a request.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.740
Her curry is really delicious!

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.070
All right, all right.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.950
Later.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.980
Sheesh.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.740
Gimme a break...

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.490
What's wrong with you, Ma?
This isn't Hokkaido!

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.580
Lock the damn door, at least.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.500
Hey...

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.340
Hey...

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.300
Answer me.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.380
You kidding me, right? Cut it out.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.720
Get up, Ma!

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.310
Fujinuma-san, your mother shared
 some of her curry with me last night...

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.020
Wait!

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.820
Fujinuma-san had blood on his hands.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.780
Are you Fujinuma Satoru-san?

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.570
I need to take you down to the station.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:20.570
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.120
<i>Wrong. You're wrong.</i>

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.040
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:26.250
<i>I didn't do it!</i>

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.790
Hey, wait!

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.220
<i>Did I...</i>

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.180
<i>have another Revival?</i>

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.520
<i>Where am I, though?</i>

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.940
<i>I know I've seen it before.</i>

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.730
<i>But somehow...</i>

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.530
Yo, Satoru! You're gonna be late!

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.530
<i>Huh? Who's that again?</i>

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.330
<i>A backpack?</i>
